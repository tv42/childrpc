 ``childrpc`` -- use Go's ``rpc`` to talk to subprocesses
==========================================================

``childrpc`` is a utility package and demonstration of how to use the
``rpc`` package to talk to things that are not typical TCP/IP servers.

You will need to have the ``moreio`` package installed for it to work.

The example provided does one round of a simple ping-pong
communication with the child process.
